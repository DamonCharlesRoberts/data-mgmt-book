# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book was originally inspired by a blog post that I had written and tried to find a more formal outlet for. When writing the blog post, a nagging thought kept hanging in the back of my mind, "What if you write this as a book?" I knew that this was a dangerous thought. At the time I was preparing for the academic job market and was in the throes of writing my dissertation (another book project). What a dumb idea. But, I was passionate about the topic and needed something to do when I needed a break from my dissertation. So, this project was born.
